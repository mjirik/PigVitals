To get started with PigVitals, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kubarada/PigVitals.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PigVitals
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    docker compose up

## Application 
The application visualizes data from MongoDB provided by a REST API that processes video content. It analyzes videos, turning insights into clear visual representations. This helps users quickly understand and make decisions based on the video data. Web application was build using Flask, while the REST API uses mainly MMTracking for video procesing, with the usage of neural network models.
